AutoCode SBC 2024 – Staircase Compliance Checker

This project is part of the AI Applied to Architecture & Construction master’s program.
It demonstrates an AI-assisted code-compliance tool built using Google Colab and Python, following the Saudi Building Code SBC 2024 staircase requirements.
Objective

Automatically validate staircase geometry according to SBC 2024 rules using simple user inputs.

The application checks:

Riser height (max 175 mm)

Tread width (min 275 mm)

Flight width (min 1100 mm)

Landing width

Handrail & guardrail requirements

Overhead clearance

Door obstruction conditions
How It Works

The tool takes user inputs for stair dimensions and applies rule-based logic derived from the PRD (Prompt Requirements Document).
The output is a compliance summary showing:

Compliant

Non-compliant

Warnings

Suggestions for correction
